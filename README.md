**cnn - Convolutional Neural Networks in theano**

This repo implements so far:
    - Stochastic Gradient descent (with/without validation);
    - Logistic Regression;
    - Multi Layer Perceptron;
    - Convolutional Neural Network.

Code wildly inspired by [deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html) tutorials.
